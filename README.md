## GPU   

A CPU is designed for general-purpose computations. A GPU is designed to perform the same task on different cores, like matrix operations, array transformations, image processing tasks, etc.

## Unified Memory    

One objective of Unified Memory is to minimize (or eliminate) copying input data and results between CPU and GPU.     

Apple devices ship with Unified Memory from 2020 to give a single address space of high-performance memory that can access data between CPUs, GPUs, Neural Engine, or hardware-assisted video processing.

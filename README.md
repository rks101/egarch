egarch => Pronounced as easy-arch, it is a compilation of topics relevant to computer science. I do not advocate for any company or market any product from a company. Their inclusion here is merely to understand the topic and some advanced concepts.

## GPU   

A CPU is designed for general-purpose computations. A GPU is designed to perform the same task on different cores, like matrix operations, array transformations, image processing tasks, etc.

## Unified Memory    

One objective of Unified Memory is to minimize (or eliminate) copying input data and results between CPU and GPU.     

Apple devices ship with Unified Memory from 2020 to give a single address space of high-performance memory that can access data between CPUs, GPUs, Neural Engine, or hardware-assisted video processing.

## nm   

nm stands for Nano-Meter, one billionth of a meter.    

[In a processor, what does nm refer to?](https://www.vyrian.com/what-nm-stands-for-in-a-processor-and-why-it-is-important/)    

Nanometer technology measures the distance between adjoining transistors in processors or sizes of transistors used in tablets, laptops, phones, etc. As the technology node moved from reference to 60nm to 45 nm, 15 nm, 10 nm, 7 nm => This means more transistors are placed in the same areas (per square millimeter). This allows for more power-efficient and faster processors.   

A smaller distance will significantly reduce the distance electrons travel and their overall performance. A small nm in a processor means less energy consumption, faster computing power, smaller die size, less heat dissipation, and less thermal output around the board/chipset.
